A full music replacement and collection of supporting tweaks focused on Metroid II and its remakes, while drawing inspiration from other titles in the series to fill out the experience. Just as AM2R did.

# ABOUT

Originally started as a personal project to replace a lost mod that exclusively used the gameboy soundtrack, now turned into a much more involved public release with way more work put into it than I had ever imagined.  

Every music track in AM2R has been replaced and edited in some way. Some of those replacements were re-recorded because nothing available was good enough, some were restored from the best recordings I could find, and everything was laboured over to be made as clear, seamless, and true to the source as possible. I grew up with these games in their eras, and achieving accuracy in the mod's presentation was paramount during development.  

Due to the way GameMaker handles looping, songs with intros were extended to 30mins in hopes that you don't loop back around to the intro even if you pause for a bit. Boss themes with intros were extended to 10mins. For all songs, the footprint has been kept from approximately .5 to 1mb/min of music time.  

The placement of music throughout the game has been changed around both to better mirror the gameboy version and to fit all of the new stuff in. Many more scripts, objects, and events have been created, altered, and/or re-synced to support the new audio.

Though many changes were made throughout the game to the audio presentation, the pacing of the game itself has been left largely unchanged to preserve the feel of a normal run. There are no new shortcuts or other changes to the map and no changes to anything mechanical. It's just a new soundtrack selection and set of supporting adjustments, curated and created to celebrate this game and the history that inspired it.  

# NOTABLES
-Over 200 script, object, and room code alterations, including solutions to some audio issues from the base game.  
-57 total tracks to AM2R's 46 with more on the way.  
-49 hand-crafted, low-carb, artisan edits made specifically for this mod.  
-15 extensions, while 21 others lie on the cutting room floor.  
-6 tracks kept from AM2R with 5 total changes.  
-4 of the seven tracks from Super Metroid have been restored with nearly all background noise, clipping, and snes imperfections removed.  
-2 major official song edits.  
-1 labour of love.

### Current Track Count by Game
Gameboy - 22+1 (ALL TRACKS!)  
AM2R - 6+1  
Samus Returns - 10  
NES - 1  
Super - 7

### A World-First Discovery?!
-It's my belief that both of Gameboy's Metroid Nest themes loop after 1h46m24s. Each of the four sound channels very fittingly revolving like the cosmos. They are not the only tracks that do this in the game, and have been kept in their entirety for the mod.  
> Yes, I've considered writing to Yoshitomi-san about it...
