# AM2R Audial Tribute Mod 
This is a nearly full music replacement mod with a heavy focus on Metroid 2 and its remakes.  

Originally started as a personal project to replace a mod I got from someone else a long time ago that exclusively used the gameboy soundtrack, now turned into a much more involved full-blown public release with way more work put into it than I had ever imagined.

CURRENT TRACK COUNT BY GAME:  
Gameboy - 20  
AM2R - 7  
DS - 9  
NES - 1  
Super - 5  
Fusion - 3  
Prime - 4  
Prime 2 - 5  

Almost every music track in AM2R has been replaced and edited in some way, and are still a work in-progress though now mostly complete. You can see which files still need work by looking at the .ogg comments in the mod folder. Some were re-recorded because nothing available was good enough, some were restored from the best recordings I could find, and everything was laboured over to be made as clear, seamless, and true to the source as possible. I grew up with these games in their eras and accuracy is paramount.

Every track from the Gameboy game is here. The DUNDUNDUNDUNdundundun is gone though for now along with the "Metroid Eliminated" fanfare.  

Because of the way Gamemaker handles looping, songs with intros were extended to 30mins in hopes that you don't loop back around to the intro even if you pause for a bit. For all songs, I kept the footprint to about 1mb/min of music time, and am actively working to continue reducing the mod's overall size as much as possible by turning those extensions into much shorter single loops. Over three revisions so far, the mod's size has already been reduced from 920MB to 531MB.

Many room music transitions and starting BGMs in save rooms have been changed around for better continuity and to better fit all the new stuff in. Many scripts and objects were also altered to better facilitate more loops and reduce the need for extensions.

To-Do:  
-Record and touch-up remaining 6 songs. (0.9.5) <- Might take a bit.  
-Final script and object adjustments. EggTrigger, OmegaFight, Thoth Elevator, etc. (0.9.6)  
-Final quality pass, title screen(HELP!), trailer(HELP!), credits, (1.0)  
-Make it a dark and stormy night on Thoth. (1.1)  
-If possible, figure out a way to get the DUNDUNDUNDUNdundundun and "Metroid Eliminated" fanfare in here. (1.2 or earlier if figured out prior)  

Anyone that has solutions to things I'm working on or is willing to help with a title screen or short trailer, please let me know.
